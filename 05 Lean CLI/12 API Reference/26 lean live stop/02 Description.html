<p>This command stops live trading, but without taking care of any existing positions for the given local-live-trading project. You may consider doing so if you wish to have minor code change, or add some manual trades but redeploy the live algorithm after that, to minimize the stopping effect. Sccuessful requests would return <code>live.get_result(): stop - Success: The command was executed successfully</code>, while failed requests would return <code>live.get_result(): stop - Failed: to execute the command successfully. &lt;error message&gt;</code></p>
