<p>This command stops live trading, but without taking care of any existing positions for the given cloud-live-trading project. You may consider doing so if you wish to have minor code change, or add some manual trades but redeploy the live algorithm after that, to minimize the stopping effect. Successful request would return <code>cloud.live.stop(): command executed successfully.</code>, while failed request would return <code>cloud.live.stop(): Failed: to execute the command successfully.</code></p>
